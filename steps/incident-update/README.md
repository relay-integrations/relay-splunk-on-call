# splunkoncall-step-incident-update

This step updates a Splunk On-Call timeline with information from a Relay workflow.  It will update the account timeline and optionally, if an `entity_id` for an existing incident is supplied to the step, will associate the update with that incident. It posts as `INFO` level messages. It requires that you enable the REST integration on your Splunk On-Call account; doing so will generate a unique URL that you should store as a Secret named `endpointURL` in Relay, associated with this workflow.
